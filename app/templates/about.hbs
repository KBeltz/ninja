        <h3>Shotokan vs. Chung Do Kwan: History of Tae Kwon Do</h3>
        <p>Since January of 2015 I have studied the Chung Do Kwan style of tae kwon do. Chung Do Kwan was founded in 1944 by Won Kuk Lee, but it actually has its roots in the Shotokan style of karate. The father of Shotokan karate is Gichin Funakoshi. Starting at the age of eleven, Funakoshi studied two major Okinawan styles of karate, Shōrei-ryū and Shōrin-ryū. He gave the first public demonstration of karate in 1917 in Kyoto, and built a dojo at Mejiro in Tokyo in 1936. Shotokan karate got its name from the sign that Funakoshi’s students hung over the entrance to the dojo. They took the name from Shoto, which is Funakoshi’s pen name, and means “waving pines,” and kan, which means training hall or house. So Shotokan literally translates to “house of Shoto,” or “house of waving pines.” Though Funakoshi is largely credited with popularizing karate in Japan, he did not begin his mission of spreading it to the outside world until the age of 53.</p>
        <p>Won Kuk Lee began studying karate with Sensei Funakoshi  and his son Yoshitaka (Gigo) in Japan in the 1930’s. Lee returned to Korea in 1944, while Korea was still under Japanese rule, and received permission to teach karate to Japanese nationals. He was later granted permission to teach to select Koreans at a school gymnasium in Seoul. And thus, the Chungdohwe, or Blue Wave Association, was formed. It would later be renamed Chung Do Kwan in 1951. Lee referred to this art as Tang Soo Do, or China Hand Way. Due to political tensions on the heels of the end of Japan’s occupation of Korea, Lee was arrested in 1947, and by 1950 was forced to relocate to Japan. In his absence, several of Lee’s top students established their own institutes.</p>
        <p>Duk Sung Son went on to serve as Won Kuk Lee’s replacement as the headmaster of Chung Do Kwan. He continued to teach and promote Tang Soo Do, and eventually was named chief instructor of the Republic of South Korea’s Army, where he first met General Choi. General Choi had also studied karate with Gichin Funakoshi. On April 11, 1955 both Duk Sung Son and General Choi attended a special meeting of representatives of the five major kwans, members of the press, and representatives of the Korean government in order to establish a single name to unify the martial art being taught in Korea since the end of Japanese occupation.</p>
        <p>In 1959, Duk Sung Son published a letter publicly dismissing General Choi and other advanced students from the Chung Do Kwan over philosophical differences. Duk Sung Son was soon ousted from the Chung Do Kwan. As a result of backlash over this act and continued political tensions in Korea, Duk Sung Son relocated to the United States in 1963. He then began teaching Tae Kwon Do in New York City’s Central Park. Several Chung Do Kwan Masters had immigrated to the United States with him, and together they established the Tae Han Karate Association, which in 1966 became the World Taekwondo Association.</p>
        <p>One of Duk Sung Son’s students was Ki Hyung Kim. Master Kim came to the United States from Seoul in 1968. He served as the Technical Director of the World Tae Kwon Do Association, and later the National Tae Kwon Do Association. He taught tae kwon do in Omaha from 1968 to 2015, and I was honored to have been one of his students.</p>

        <h3>My Black Belt Journey</h3>
        <p>When I was a kid, starting at the age of seven I played sports year-round: softball in the spring and summer, soccer in the fall, and basketball in the winter. The first sport to go was softball. I played for about three seasons, but my heart was never in it. Being left-handed, my only “natural” spot in the infield, shortstop, was taken by a girl much more talented than I. I never excelled in the field, nor at bat, and never felt particularly encouraged. I spent all three seasons bored out in right field, and had no interest in continuing the sport. I also played basketball for several years. While I was always a fairly accurate shot in practice, I wasn’t actually all that great at playing the game itself. I tried out for the junior varsity team in ninth grade, and when I was one of only two girls cut during tryouts, I decided to call it quits for good. When I was about ten years old, I started playing indoor soccer. The indoor soccer season overlapped rather inconveniently with basketball at the time, but I didn’t care. It was like playing soccer with a giant tennis ball, and due to the fact that the field was relatively small and playing the ball off of the walls was legal, the game was fast-paced and different enough from outdoor soccer to be interesting in a completely different way. I loved it. Starting in my sophomore year of high school, my school had a varsity soccer team. I played all three years, starting out as a midfielder and working my way up to play center forward when I was a senior. I also continued to play in my recreational outdoor soccer and indoor soccer leagues until I was 18.</p>
        <p>For most of those ten or eleven years, I stayed pretty busy. I lived and breathed sports, and never really ventured outside those circles. All of those people lived and breathed sports as well; no one had much time for other extracurricular activities. I eventually met a girl in high school who transferred to my school from Virginia Beach at the beginning of my tenth grade year. She quickly became a close friend, and while she did not play in my recreational sports leagues, she was on the varsity soccer team with me. I soon learned that she went to a local Kenpo Karate school, Universal Kenpo in Daleville, VA. I attended a “Bring a Friend” class with her one day, and was enthralled. I think I was 16 at the time, and I brought the price sheet home to beg my parents to enroll me. My parents were used to paying something like $45 per season for me to play recreational sports, so they were not open to the idea of paying more than that on a monthly basis. They suggested that I pay for it on my own, since at the time I had a job working at Wendy’s on the weekends. Unfortunately, since I already had other expenses, in the form of a sweet 1987 Honda Accord, karate was not in my budget at that time.</p>
        <p>I was heartbroken, as only a teenage girl can be, and for the next 14 years or so martial arts was just not in the cards for me. Lack of money, lack of free time, being stationed on an aircraft carrier circling the south Pacific…there was always something to get in the way. It wasn’t until 2012 that everything started to come together. In May of that year I graduated from college, but I did not yet have a job. Cole started a new job with an oil company that June. I had previously looked at kids’ martial arts programs, but most in the area where we were living at the time would not take kids until they were four. Shane turned four on June 19, and we started visiting schools.</p>

        <p>We first did a trial month for Shane at a place called Karate USA. We went a few times, but I was not really impressed with their program. I remember that there were very young black belt students assisting with the classes, and their lack of focus seemed distracting to the kids in the class. We soon found our home at a school called Moohan Martial Arts that teaches olympic style tae kwon do. Cole and I joined the adult program, and Shane joined the Tiny Tigers program. The Tiny Tigers program, from what I remember, had a lot of similar activities to the ones I currently teach in Little Dragons. We trained at Moohan for about six months. When we began training, we thought it would take us several years to be able to move out of Georgia; leaving Georgia was always the goal. We got the chance much sooner than we expected, because with Cole’s job he was able to live anywhere as long as he was within a reasonable commute of a major airport. In December of 2012, we moved to Omaha from Dawsonville, Georgia. Prior to the move, I tested for and earned first my yellow belt, and then my orange belt. We intended to find a new tae kwon do school shortly after moving to Omaha, but unfortunately things don’t always work out the way that we hope.</p>
        <p>After the move, we spent some time looking for another World TaeKwonDo Federation school in Omaha. I was a bit overwhelmed and did not yet know much about all of the different styles and governing bodies in martial arts, and specifically in tae kwon do. I wanted to stick with what was familiar. Unfortunately, it was somewhat difficult to find what I was looking for, and I put my martial arts journey on hold temporarily. We enrolled Shane in jiu jitsu at the Maple St. YMCA with Sensei Abdul, and I pursued another interest of mine: roller derby.</p>
        <p>I trained for about six months with Sparks & Wreckreation, the recreational roller derby league run by the Omaha Rollergirls. In the Summer of 2013, I was training to prepare for the New Recruit Camp, when I fell on my skates and broke my left ankle. Thankfully I did not need surgery. It did not take very long to get out of the cast, but it took quite a while for my ankle to fully heal. It was stiff and painful for quite some time. By the time that I should have been fully healed, laziness and lethargy had set in. I joined the YMCA, but I had no workout partner and little motivation. I would do a half dozen spin classes over the span of a month, and then wouldn’t attend again for several months. I would do a few personal training sessions, but couldn’t keep up the motivation to do the weight routine on my own.</p>
        <p>This continued until December 2014, when we decided that Shane was old enough to move up from the casual, once-per-week YMCA jiu jitsu class to a fully dedicated youth martial arts program. As much as we enjoyed having Shane in Sensei Abdul’s jiu jitsu program, Cole and I had always intended to transition Shane back to tae kwon do, in addition to continuing our own training. We signed Shane up with Omaha Elite Tae Kwon Do, which as far as I know is the only school in Omaha that teaches World TaeKwonDo Federation Style tae kwon do. I was unimpressed with the teaching style of the single instructor/owner of that school. He had obvious star students that he was grooming for competition, and while he admitted Shane to his program, he made no visible efforts during classes to assist Shane with forms or to slow the forms down so that he could learn. We quickly left, and during the first week of January 2015 Cole, Shane, and I all signed up with Kim’s Tae Kwon Do School. </p>
        <p>I attended Kim’s Tae Kwon Do School from January 3, 2015 until the school closed on November 30, 2015. For the first several months, I was very apprehensive. I desperately wanted to learn and improve; however, I was highly intimidated by the other adult students. There were not many adult students at Kim’s, and most of them were already black belts. There was no reason for me to be so nervous; the students were never anything but kind and helpful. But I have struggled my entire adult life with anxiety and depression; such things are not always rational. As a result, I preferred to attend the 4:30pm adult classes, which often meant that Cole and I were the only students in the class. Mister Price was usually our instructor for those classes, but Master Kim was always present to give us tips on our stances, to pull us aside to practice roundhouse kicks until our form was acceptable, or to interject with one of his numerous stories. I have many fond memories about my time at Kim’s Tae Kwon Do School. I remember the patience with which Mister Price would answer my countless questions when learning a new form or one step sparring technique. I remember all of the time Master Kim spent with me standing next to the bar, helping me improve my kicks. On October 12, 2015 Shane tested privately for his purple belt with Master Kim. That, sadly, was the last test Master Kim ever conducted. I had an appointment to test for purple belt with him on October 14, but when I arrived that afternoon I was informed that Master Kim was taking a few days off. A few weeks later we learned about Master Kim’s stroke, and that the school would close permanently at the end of November. </p>
        <p>The closing of Kim’s Tae Kwon Do School, while tragic in its own right, came at a difficult time for me personally. I had just begun to feel more comfortable, more confident during my classes. I felt that my skills were finally starting to improve; I had figured out how to put a bit of power and snap into my techniques. Cole and I had also been discussing our family’s future, or more specifically, whether or not we were going to move out of Omaha anytime soon. I had just finished a web development training program, and was in the process of looking for employment. I was having a difficult time finding an appropriate position in Omaha, and was trying to determine if I should widen my search to include other cities. While it was not the only reason that we chose not to pursue moving out toward the west coast at that time, tae kwon do was one of the main reasons that we decided to stay here. We did not wish to move and start over again in our training, nor did we want to go through the arduous process of researching schools in a new town and attempting to find one that we liked. </p>
        <p>Unfortunately, we ended up having to look for a new school anyway. Fortunately, however, we found a home at Midwest Tae Kwon Do. Initially what drew us to this school was the fact that Master Todd had also studied tae kwon do under Master Kim, and that the school teaches the same Chung Do Kwan style that we were used to. We were allowed to retain our belt ranks, which was also important to us. Location was also important; as all three members of my family practice tae kwon do, we anticipated spending 4-5 evenings per week at the dojo/dojang, and did not want to have a long commute to train each evening after work or school. Additionally, the school was very welcoming right away; there were other schools that we visited where we were basically ignored, even though it was obvious that there were other instructors or employees present that were not teaching class at the time.</p>

        <h3>My Martial Arts Future</h3>
        <p>I don’t imagine one specific path for my future in martial arts. I have goals, but I am open to experiencing whatever journey life has in store for me. My goals are to always continue learning, and to keep training as long as I am physically able. Earning a black belt is not the end of a journey, but rather, the beginning of a new one. I plan to continue to improve myself both physically and mentally as a martial artist, as well as to improve my skills as an instructor. I feel that my own personal training is also important as an instructor; it is important for students to see their instructors always striving to be better at what they do in order for them to understand the importance of perseverance, and to reinforce that a black belt does not have to be a final goal; martial arts is a way of life. Eventually, someday when I am not as pressed for time in my personal life as I have been in recent years, I would like to consider studying other martial arts as well.</p>

        <h3>Why Should I Be Considered?</h3>
        <p>While physical training and striving for improvement in both kihon and kata are certainly very important, I do not think that what makes a person a martial artist is perfect kicks, perfect stances, or perfect kata performances. I believe that what makes a person a martial artist is their heart. I believe that I should be considered for a black belt because I take to heart the principles of a black belt, also referred to as the tenets of tae kwon do: courtesy, integrity, perseverance, self-control and indomitable spirit. As a martial artist, I am always striving to embody those principles. As a martial arts instructor, I am always striving to teach those principles to students. As a human being, I believe that these principles are relevant outside of the dojo as well. I do not leave them at the door; I live by them.</p>
